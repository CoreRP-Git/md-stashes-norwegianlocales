<b> Step Two </b>
  
- Fill out your config
  - follow the disclaimer above

<p> </p>

<h1>How It Works</h1>

- use command newstash and fill in the things you want
- use command editStashes to edit the required data to open stashes
- use command DeleteStashes to delete stashes -- thanks @bobatari

<h1> Common Questions </h1>

- the items wont get out of the inventory and into my pockets
  - not my scripts problem. This is merely a way to **open** stashes. thats it. once you open the stash my script stops. 
- weapons lose durability when i put them in the stash
  - again, not my script.

<h1>Fivemerr</h1>
This is NOT a requirement but something I personally use and believe in.


- to integrate with fivemerr make sure you have  ```set fivemerrLogs "API_KEY"```   in your server.cfg
   
- Head to /server/bridge.lua and line 3 turn local logs = true
  
- profit

Why integrate with Fivemerr? Its a great place to store logs as it doesnt rely on discord webhooks and its far easier to search through

As well as a place to offload images and videos from fivem that doesnt rely on discord since discord API will be automatically deleting images and videos after a certain amount of time If you need an invite to their server look below
